# DeleteRoblox
PowerShell scripts that deletes Roblox from devices periodically, as to make the user's life a living hell

I wrote these in order to try and delete roblox from student devices at a school I worked at.

One of the scripts deletes Roblox if it is on an AzureAD joined device.
The other script does the same thing, but it turns it into a scheduled task to delete Roblox daily.

Messy scripts, might try and clean them up in the future, make them applicable to ALL devices, not just AzureAD joined ones...
